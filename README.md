# Precision matrix estimation under nonnegative partial correlations

This MATLAB package includes implementations of fast projected Newton-like algorithm presented in [1]. The licensing information is available in LICENSE.txt

The algorithm aims to estimate precision matrices in multivariate Gaussian distributions where all partial correlations are nonnegative, also known as multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP2).

To install the package:
(1) Download the source files.
(2) Run 'demo.m'
